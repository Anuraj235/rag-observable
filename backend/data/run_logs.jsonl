While natural processes can contribute to climate variation, the current trend of global warming is primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. These activities release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere. The consequences of climate change include more frequent and intense heatwaves, rising sea levels, changing precipitation patterns, and an increased risk of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. Ecosystems are also affected: some species may migrate to cooler regions, while others face extinction if they cannot adapt quickly enough. Mitigation and adaptation are the two main strategies for dealing with climate change. Mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy, energy efficiency, and changes in land use. Adaptation involves preparing for the impacts that are already unavoidable, such as building sea walls, improving water management, and developing heat-resilient infrastructure."}, {"source": "ml_basics.txt", "chunk": 1, "doc_id": "ml_basics.txt::1", "distance": 0.8814071416854858, "relevance": "Off-topic", "text": "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems which learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed. In supervised learning, a model is trained on labeled examples so that it can predict labels for new inputs. Common supervised learning tasks include classification, where the model predicts a category, and regression, where the model predicts a numeric value. Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The goal is often to discover hidden structure, such as clusters of similar points or lower-dimensional representations. Clustering algorithms, like k-means, group similar observations together based on their features. Dimensionality reduction methods, like principal component analysis (PCA), compress high-dimensional data into a smaller number of meaningful components. Evaluation of machine learning models typically involves splitting the dataset into training and test sets. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error are used to judge how well the model performs. Overfitting happens when a model memorizes the training data instead of learning general patterns, causing poor performance on new data. Regularization, cross-validation, and collecting more data are common strategies to reduce overfitting."}, {"source": "psychology_of_habits.txt", "chunk": 2, "doc_id": "psychology_of_habits.txt::2", "distance": 0.9425464868545532, "relevance": "Off-topic", "text": "Habits are learned behaviors that become automatic responses to specific cues in our environment. According to a common model, habits follow a cueroutinereward loop. The cue is a trigger that tells the brain to go into automatic mode, the routine is the behavior itself, and the reward is the positive outcome that reinforces the habit over time. Forming a new habit usually requires consistent repetition in the same context. Research suggests that it can take several weeks or months for a behavior to become automatic, depending on its complexity and how often it is performed. Small, easy habits are more likely to stick than large, drastic changes that require a lot of willpower. Breaking an unwanted habit often involves identifying and changing the cue or the reward. For example, if stress is the cue for unhealthy snacking, someone might replace the routine of eating junk food with a short walk or a breathing exercise that provides a similar sense of relief. Designing the environment to make good habits easier and bad habits harder is a powerful strategy in behavior change."}]}
