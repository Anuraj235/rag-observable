Habits are learned behaviors that become automatic responses to specific cues in our environment. According to a common model, habits follow a cue–routine–reward loop. The cue is a trigger that tells the brain to go into automatic mode, the routine is the behavior itself, and the reward is the positive outcome that reinforces the habit over time.

Forming a new habit usually requires consistent repetition in the same context. Research suggests that it can take several weeks or months for a behavior to become automatic, depending on its complexity and how often it is performed. Small, easy habits are more likely to stick than large, drastic changes that require a lot of willpower.

Breaking an unwanted habit often involves identifying and changing the cue or the reward. For example, if stress is the cue for unhealthy snacking, someone might replace the routine of eating junk food with a short walk or a breathing exercise that provides a similar sense of relief. Designing the environment to make good habits easier and bad habits harder is a powerful strategy in behavior change.
