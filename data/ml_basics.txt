Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems which learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed. In supervised learning, a model is trained on labeled examples so that it can predict labels for new inputs. Common supervised learning tasks include classification, where the model predicts a category, and regression, where the model predicts a numeric value.

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The goal is often to discover hidden structure, such as clusters of similar points or lower-dimensional representations. Clustering algorithms, like k-means, group similar observations together based on their features. Dimensionality reduction methods, like principal component analysis (PCA), compress high-dimensional data into a smaller number of meaningful components.

Evaluation of machine learning models typically involves splitting the dataset into training and test sets. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error are used to judge how well the model performs. Overfitting happens when a model memorizes the training data instead of learning general patterns, causing poor performance on new data. Regularization, cross-validation, and collecting more data are common strategies to reduce overfitting.
