Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While natural processes can contribute to climate variation, the current trend of global warming is primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. These activities release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere.

The consequences of climate change include more frequent and intense heatwaves, rising sea levels, changing precipitation patterns, and an increased risk of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. Ecosystems are also affected: some species may migrate to cooler regions, while others face extinction if they cannot adapt quickly enough.

Mitigation and adaptation are the two main strategies for dealing with climate change. Mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy, energy efficiency, and changes in land use. Adaptation involves preparing for the impacts that are already unavoidable, such as building sea walls, improving water management, and developing heat-resilient infrastructure.
